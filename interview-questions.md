# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
  An iteration is a function that takes in an array and will continuously run through it until a condition is met.

  Researched answer:
Iterations can be found in functions such as a "for loop." Iterations are pretty common in programming when you want your program to run through a task multiple times or until it finds the desired outcome. 


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:
The built in method .map() takes in, the value, the location, and off the top of my head without taking a peak I can't recall the last perameter, however, the only one that it MUST have is the value. 
  Researched answer:
After some research through the syllabus, I realized I managed to be half correct! So, the map() requires a value also known as the "argument" It can have (but is not required to have) an index (what I refered to as "location) and the last parameter was an array, which thus far in my experience is not necessary, but is common. 



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
All I can recall when I think about object destructuring is Austin's example of needing to access our variables inside the plastic baggy. This is where we would call on our arrow functions and "let" to get into our arrays and work with the values within them. 
  Researched answer:
So after a bit of research, i'm keeping true to the plastic baggy analogy but simplifying my definition of "object destructuring" to the method of breaking down an object to gain access to those individual variables and then creating new variables to return less lengthy code. 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer:
A function is like a map, it gives specific details and a method is like your navigation system, in that it has a map(function) built into it and it is referencing the map(or function).
  Researched answer:
Functions will take in data and spit out whatever you tell it to, it's like a baseline equation in JavaScript. Methods are when you start adding in functions into an object, the outcome is a method. 


5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
  An object can contain a function or return a location, and I think classes are similar to objects but I recall it being a "blue print" for an object and I would have to dive deeper to find why.

  Researched answer:
  So objects take in "specific" key value pairs and classes are known as the blue print because you can take an object and make it re-useable. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  I would be 100% lying if I told you I knew anything about hoisting, but if I had to make an uneducated guess... it would be that hoisting is a complex method that steals functions (if hoisting means lifting in the stealing sense) from other methods. 

  Researched answer:
  After researching, it seems like hoisting is when you write a function and declare it then later you can call on that function without declaring it and it will still work from your previous code.
